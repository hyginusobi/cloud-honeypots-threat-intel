# Architecture Overview

## Introduction
This project uses a **cloud-based honeypot architecture** designed to safely attract, observe, and analyse malicious activity while maintaining strong isolation from production systems.

The architecture follows **security-by-design** and **least privilege** principles, ensuring that attacker interaction is contained and monitored without introducing additional risk to the wider environment.

---

## High-Level Architecture Design
The environment is deployed within **Microsoft Azure** and consists of the following core components:

- Cloud-hosted virtual machines configured as honeypots
- Segmented virtual network architecture
- Network Security Groups (NSGs) to tightly control ingress and egress traffic
- Centralised logging and monitoring pipeline
- Analysis layer for identifying attacker behaviour and trends

This design ensures that all malicious activity is captured in a **controlled and observable environment**.

---

## Network Segmentation & Isolation
Network isolation is a critical aspect of the architecture.

Key controls include:
- Dedicated Virtual Network (VNet) for honeypot resources
- Subnet-level isolation to prevent lateral movement
- Strict NSG rules allowing only required inbound traffic
- No direct connectivity to production or internal systems

These controls ensure that attackers interacting with the honeypots cannot pivot beyond the intended environment.

---

## Honeypot Layer
The honeypot layer consists of cloud-hosted virtual machines configured to simulate vulnerable or attractive services.

Characteristics of this layer include:
- Exposure of commonly targeted services
- Minimal system hardening to encourage interaction
- No sensitive data stored on the systems
- Continuous monitoring of authentication attempts and service access

The goal of this layer is **observation**, not deception for exploitation.

---

## Logging & Monitoring Architecture
All relevant events generated by the honeypots are forwarded to a central logging pipeline.

Logged data includes:
- Network connection attempts
- Authentication events
- Command execution attempts
- Service interaction logs

Centralised logging enables:
- Correlation of attacker activity
- Identification of recurring patterns
- Support for SOC-style investigation workflows

Detailed logging implementation is documented in the deployment section.

---

## Analysis & Threat Intelligence Layer
Captured logs are analysed to extract actionable insights, including:
- Attacker tactics and techniques
- Frequently targeted services and ports
- Indicators of compromise (sanitised)
- Behavioural patterns aligned to known threat actor activity

Where applicable, findings are mapped to the **MITRE ATT&CK framework** to support structured threat intelligence reporting.

---

## Security Controls
The architecture incorporates multiple security controls to ensure safe operation:

- Network isolation and segmentation
- Least privilege access to cloud resources
- No outbound trust relationships
- Continuous monitoring and alerting
- Sanitisation of collected data

These controls reduce risk while allowing realistic attacker interaction.

---

## Design Rationale
This architecture was chosen to balance:
- Realism (attracting genuine attacker behaviour)
- Safety (preventing unintended impact)
- Observability (maximising intelligence value)
- Scalability (cloud-native deployment)

It reflects common patterns used in **enterprise security research and SOC environments**.

---

## Limitations
While effective for threat intelligence collection, the architecture has known limitations:
- Honeypots may not capture advanced targeted attacks
- Activity may be biased toward automated scanning
- Cloud-based deployment may differ from on-premise attack surfaces

These limitations are addressed further in the lessons learned section.

---

## Summary
The architecture provides a secure, observable, and scalable foundation for cloud-based threat intelligence collection. It demonstrates practical cloud security design, SOC alignment, and an understanding of real-world attacker behaviour.
