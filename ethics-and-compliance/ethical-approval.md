# Ethical Approval

## Overview
This project was conducted as part of an MSc Applied Cybersecurity programme and followed established ethical research principles for defensive security experimentation.

The deployment of cloud-based honeypots was designed strictly for **observation and analysis**, without engaging in offensive activity or active interaction with attackers.

---

## Research Context
- Academic research project
- Defensive security focus
- No real user data involved
- No production systems impacted

---

## Ethical Safeguards Applied
- Honeypots deployed in isolated cloud environments
- No lateral movement or exploitation beyond passive logging
- No attempt to identify or retaliate against attackers
- No interaction with third-party systems

---

## Institutional Alignment
The project aligns with:
- University research ethics guidance
- Responsible cybersecurity research principles
- Industry best practice for threat intelligence research

---

## Ethical Outcome
The research demonstrates that meaningful threat intelligence can be collected responsibly, without harm to individuals, organisations, or infrastructure.
