# Limitations and Ethical Considerations

## Project Limitations
- Honeypots primarily attract opportunistic attackers
- Findings may not represent advanced persistent threat activity
- Attribution is not possible from observed behaviour alone
- Results depend on exposure configuration and observation period

---

## Ethical Considerations
This project was designed and conducted with strict ethical controls:

- No targeting of real individuals or organisations
- No exploitation beyond passive observation
- No interaction with attacker infrastructure beyond necessary logging
- No collection of personally identifiable information (PII)

---

## Responsible Disclosure
- All data presented is anonymised and sanitised
- Indicators are shared for defensive purposes only
- The project does not facilitate offensive misuse

---

## Legal Considerations
- Activities align with defensive research practices
- No unauthorised access to third-party systems
- No breach of cloud provider acceptable use policies

---

## Ethical Outcome
The project demonstrates that meaningful threat intelligence can be gathered **ethically, legally, and responsibly**.
