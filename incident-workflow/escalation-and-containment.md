# Escalation and Containment

## Escalation Criteria
Events are escalated when:
- Behaviour indicates persistence
- Multiple attack stages observed
- High-confidence malicious intent detected

---

## Containment Strategy
In a production environment this would include:
- Network isolation
- Credential resets
- Firewall rule updates

In this project:
- No containment actions were executed
- Observations documented only

---

## Rationale
Maintains ethical research boundaries while preserving intelligence value.
