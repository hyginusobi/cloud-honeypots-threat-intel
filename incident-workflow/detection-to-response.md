# Detection to Response Workflow

## Overview
This document outlines the end-to-end workflow from threat detection to response, based on observations from the honeypot deployment.

---

## Detection
- Alerts triggered from log correlation
- Behaviour-based indicators prioritised
- Noise filtered through thresholds

---

## Initial Assessment
- Validate alert legitimacy
- Identify affected honeypot
- Determine attack stage

---

## Response Decision
- No active blocking (research context)
- Classification for intelligence purposes
- Documentation of observed behaviour

---

## Outcome
This workflow mirrors SOC Level 1 and Level 2 processes in real environments.
